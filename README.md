# 🚗 Road Lane Line Detection

This project focuses on detecting lane lines on the road using image and video processing techniques. It can be applied in real-time systems such as autonomous vehicles or advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).

## 📌 Overview

The goal is to identify and highlight lane boundaries in road images and videos. The project utilizes computer vision techniques to process frames and accurately detect lane lines, even in varying lighting and weather conditions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** — Programming language
- **OpenCV** — Image processing and computer vision operations
- **NumPy** — Numerical operations and matrix manipulation
- **Matplotlib** — Visualization of image outputs
- **Matplotlib / OpenCV GUI** — For displaying real-time detection
- **TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch** — If using deep learning for lane detection

## ✅ Features

- Detect lane lines from images or video input
- Apply edge detection and region masking
- Use Hough Transform to detect lines
- Overlay detected lanes on the original video stream
- Supports curved lane detection with polynomial fitting (if implemented)

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Helps self-driving cars stay within lanes by understanding road structure.
- **Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)**: Alerts or guides human drivers to maintain lane discipline.
- **Traffic Analysis**: Can be used to analyze lane behavior in traffic management systems.
- **Educational Purpose**: Useful for students and researchers learning computer vision.
